For the project, we use a Neural Network Classification algorithm to predict whether a tweet is about a disaster or not.
## Metrics of Success

We use accuracy Score, confusion matrix and classification report as the metrics for testing perfomance of our models.


## Understanding the context
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster
